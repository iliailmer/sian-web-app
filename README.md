# Maple Cloud version of Structural Identifiability Analyzer

The web-version is available [here](https://maple.cloud/app/5710317752942592/SIAN).

This app allows to assess (local and global) identifiability/observability for models defined by systems of parametric ODEs. The app uses [SIAN software](https://github.com/pogudingleb/SIAN) on the backend. The algorithm is based on the following papers:

* [Global Identifiability of Differential Models](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.21921) (Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, Volume 73, Issue 9, Pages 1831-1879, 2020) 
* [SIAN: software for structural identifiability analysis of ODE models](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/16/2873/5270661) (Bioinformatics, Volume 35, Issue 16, Pages 2873â€“2874, 2019)

In addition, this program can determine identifiability of functions of parameters for single- and multiple-experiment scenarios as described in
[Computing All Identifiable Functions of ODE Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07774.pdf); for original Maple implementation see [this repo](https://github.com/pogudingleb/AllIdentifiableFunctions).
